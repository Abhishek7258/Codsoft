As a dedicated and enthusiastic #intern at CodSoft , I successfully completed a project focused on developing a fully functional #calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Throughout this task, I applied my knowledge of web development technologies to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. By leveraging #HTML for structuring the content, #CSS for styling, and #JavaScript for implementing the calculator's logic, I was able to deliver a seamless and interactive user experience. This project not only honed my technical skills but also enhanced my problem-solving abilities and attention to detail, preparing me for future challenges in the field of web development.
